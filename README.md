# Rust Practice

This repository contains a few different little projects I've made to learn and improve in Rust. If you want to run any of these projects locally, make sure to [have Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsrobinson/rust-practice.git
cd rust-practice
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
cargo run
```
